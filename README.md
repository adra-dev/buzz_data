# Bootcamp MachineLearning
In this project I am going to simulate a real life scenario of a MachineLearning project step by step.
First we need define the project, since we already have information about the objective we can part from there by detailing parameters for the **SMART** goals

1. Specific
    - What needs to be accomplished?
        - population prediction system
        - data visualization. 
2. Mesurable
    - How do I mesure my model results?
        - Making the prediction of new values using historical data.
3. Achivable
    - is your objective something your team can reasonably accomplish?
        - It is achivable.
4. Relevant
    - Why are you setting the goal that you’re setting?
        - Create a linear regresion model and predict new values.
        - Create data visualization.
5. Time-Bound
    - 24 days from 20/January/2024 to 12/February/2024
